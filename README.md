# Credit Card Default Analysis

A Mini Project using Logistic Regression on Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset


In this mini project, I will be working on a classification problem of predicting whether a credit card client will default or not. 
For this problem, I will use Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset. 

In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled "default.payment.next.month" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. I took some ideas and compared my results with the associated research paper, which is available through the UBC library.
